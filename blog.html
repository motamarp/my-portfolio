    <h2>Entry 1: Reflection on Completing the Assignment</h2>
    <p>Date: 10/14/2024</p>
    <p>This assignment was relatively easy. I just had an issue with finding how to make a key from github. Overall, I feel confident for future assignments. I already knew most of how to format the file, but the resources I found most useful were actual youtube videos and github help pages. Only then was I able to understand truly how to make an SSH key.</p>
